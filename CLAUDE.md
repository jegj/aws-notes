# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code)
when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AWS certification study notes repository. It is
a pure documentation/knowledge base project with no
application code, build system, tests, or CI/CD pipeline.

## Structure

All content lives in `README.md` as structured Markdown,
organized by AWS certification topic (currently focused on
AWS Cloud Practitioner). Topics covered include the
Well-Architected Framework, S3 Storage Classes, EC2 Pricing,
and AWS Support Plans.

## Conventions

- Content is written in GitHub-flavored Markdown
- Each major AWS topic gets its own top-level heading (`##`)
- Subtopics use nested headings, bullet points, and numbered lists
- Include practical details: features, use cases, pricing, and comparisons
